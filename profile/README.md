## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the GitHub for the **Canadian Ecological & Epidemiological Forecasting Initiative**, *aka* CEFI.

We are a grassroots organization on a mission to build capacity in Canada for generating ecological and epidemiological forecasts aimed at informing decisions. 

The CEFI GitHub means to promote transparency in the forecasting process and improve how to model in an uncertain future.
